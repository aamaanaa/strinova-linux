### NOTE about bottles
The Author, i, aamaanaa, will ONLY give support for Lutris based installs. Botles has been added by the comunity, and i will not provide support for that, but the community hopefully will.

### NOTE about Steam
there are reports that the steam version works, with tweaks. If anyone wants to make a guide for that, open up a pull request.

### Hardware support
- **AMD users**: Should work out of the box on any AMD GPU without issues.
- **Nvidia users**: might have black screen artifacting, fps issues.

### Bannable?
So far there are **no reports with bans**. The installation methods in this repo do not modify game files, use injection, or any other alterations.
I can highly recommend to [Read the bans discussion](https://github.com/aamaanaa/strinova-linux/discussions/31).

I still advice you to not share / show your `accountID` when mentioning that you running Strinova on Linux, for example exposed in a youtube video, a reddit post, or a screenshot!

You may search for anticheat issues based on the [`anticheat`](https://github.com/aamaanaa/strinova-linux/issues?q=label%3Aanticheat) label.
