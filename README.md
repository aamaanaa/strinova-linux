### NOTE about Lutris YAML install!!!
If you use the YAML install method for lutris, you might into a issue as described in [`Issue: 38`](https://github.com/aamaanaa/strinova-linux/issues/38)
I MAY need to program something to some how automate the install, or properly install correct wine runner and generate a YAML file out of that.

### NOTE about bottles
The Author, i, aamaanaa, will ONLY give support for Lutris based installs. Botles has been added by the comunity, and i will not provide support for that, but the community hopefully will.
