# Strinova on linux
Lutris script and guide to let strinova run on linux. It works by setting a certain registery key, and that seems to manage the conflict the anticheat has with winedbg.

- Tested on Fedora 42

## Instructions
- install lutris.
- Download the yaml playbook, and in lutris, select that yaml file and install the game that way
- That is it

## Notes
It may be required to start the game with a Wine version of at least 10.0+ (wine-tkg is tested).
A crash window will appear. Ignore it. Do not click any of the buttons in the crash window â€” if you do, the game will crash.
    
Afther the installer is done, download the entire game, and afther that set the wine runner to wine-tkg 10 +. 

It may be needed to set the wine runner to a lower version due the launcher crashing when downloading. It appears that wine-ge-proton-8.26 works.

Nvidia users report that the game does not launch at all. More info is needed on this. I have AMD so i would not know how to fix it.
