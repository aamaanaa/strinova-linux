Lutris script and guide to let strinova run on linux

## Instructions
- install lutris.
- Download the yaml playbook, and in lutris, select that yaml file and install the game that way
- That is it

## Notes
It may be required to start the game with a Wine version of at least 10.0+ (wine-tkg is tested).
A crash window will appear. Ignore it. Do not click any of the buttons in the crash window â€” if you do, the game will crash.
  
Install the launcher, click install, and then close it. Do not yet start it!
  
Afther the installer is done, download the entire game, and afther that set the wine runner to wine-tkg 10 +. 

It may be needed to set the wine runner to a lower version due the launcher crashing when downloading. It appears that wine-ge-proton-8.26 works.
