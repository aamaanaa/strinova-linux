# Strinova on linux
Lutris script and guide to let strinova run on linux. It works by setting a certain registery key, and that seems to manage the conflict the anticheat has with winedbg.

For now this is working. But since it is kernel level anticheat, i hope the devs keep it that way. Since we do not need to modify game files, it seems to me that this is not a reason to be banned, but be warned. it can happen.

- Tested on Fedora 42, with a AMD gpu.

## Instructions
- install lutris.
- Download the yaml playbook, and in lutris, select that yaml file and install the game that way
- That is it

## From the lutris website
The yaml file in this repo has been published by me to the official lutris website. You can find it here:
- https://lutris.net/games/install/39289/view

click the `+` icon in lutris, `Searh the lutris site for installers`.

## Manually import game
if you have the game already installed somewhere else and you want to import it to lutris:

- Copy game to drive_c/Strinova/Game
- In `drive_c/Strinova/config.ini` change CurrentGameVersion to `1.3.10.21` and `CurrentStage` to `INITSTAGE`. The version will fall out of date over time, copy new value from Windows or start downloading fresh to get current version string.

`drive_c/Strinova/config.ini` can be found by right clicking Strinova in lutris > Browse Files

## Notes
It may be required to start the game with a Wine version of at least 10.0+ (wine-tkg is tested).
A crash window will appear. Ignore it. Do not click any of the buttons in the crash window â€” if you do, the game will crash.
    
Afther the installer is done, download the entire game, and afther that set the wine runner to wine-tkg 10 +. 

It may be needed to set the wine runner to a lower version due the launcher crashing when downloading. It appears that wine-ge-proton-8.26 works.

Game can be played on NVIDIA GPU with some graphical issues [1]
